Manage product tabs in WooCommerce. Beautifully.

== Description ==

**Additional Custom Product Tabs for WooCommerce** plugin lets you:

* Customize WooCommerce **standard product tabs**.
* Add **custom product tabs** globally for all products, or on per product basis.
* And more...

### &#9989; Standard WooCommerce Product Tabs ###

For standard WooCommerce product tabs (i.e., "Description", "Additional information" and "Reviews") you can:

* **Remove** tab completely for all products.
* Change tab's **position**.
* Change tab's **title**.

### &#9989; Custom Product Tabs ###

For each custom product tab you can set:

* Tab's **title**.
* Tab's **ID** (i.e., link).
* Tab's **position**.
* Tab's **content**.

For each global (i.e., all products) product tab you can also set **products/categories to show/hide** it for.

### &#9989; Shortcodes ###

In product tab's title and content you can use plugin's shortcodes: `[alg_wc_pt_product_meta]` and `[alg_wc_pt_product_function]`. This is especially useful in global (i.e., all products) tabs. For example, you can output some custom field value in your custom tabs for all products at once:

`
[alg_wc_pt_product_meta key="my_custom_field"]
`

Or, for example, you could add stock quantity info:

`
Stock: [alg_wc_pt_product_function name="get_stock_quantity"]
`

### &#127942; Premium Version ###

While free version allows you to add one global custom tab and one "per product" tab for each product, with [Product Tabs for WooCommerce Pro](https://wpfactory.com/item/product-tabs-for-woocommerce-plugin/) you can add an **unlimited** number of custom product tabs.
